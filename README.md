# BlockSource
## Inspiration
We found learning a new coding language is hard at the start. With the syntax and lines being messy, and everything being overwhelming. We decided that we make a programming language that doesn't have these problems
## What it does
Blocksource has two main tabs, one with code, and one with the code visually represented. This would help let the user compare the codes and learn which part of the code is which. The blocks are also color coded corresponding to their catagory. 
## How we built it
Since the C# framework we are using is only for windows, we also made a Java version of it for cross-platforms. We first made a simple design for the UI and then slowly finished bit by bit. 
## Challenges we ran into
During the coding process, we needed to debug the code many many times, glitches kept occurring and endless hassle to get things to work. We also got tired and couldn't think properly.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to pull through all of the problems that we've encountered, by either finding a direct solution or a workaround.
## What we learned
We learned that coding can be a difficult thing to work with when building projects and that patience is required.
## What's next for Blocksource
A better more optimized and more friendly design, maybe even being the next well-known IDE (you never know).
